# Scripts

Welcome to my scripts repository. Here you can find some scripts that I use at Codam to make my life easier. Feel free to use them if you want.

## Installation
```git clone https://github.com/lithiumox-codam/scripts.git && cd scripts```

## Available scripts
- [init.sh] (This script will clone all the repositories from an account or organization and then create a VSCode workspace with all the repositories in it.)
